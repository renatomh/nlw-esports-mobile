In order to publish the app for the app stores of different kinds of devices (Play Store, App Store), there are some steps to be done.

### Android
Aside from [configuring for app publishing with React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android), we should execute the following commands to generate the *.aab* (Android App Bundle) file:
